## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I often use:
* Alt-Tab (Switch between open windows/programs)
* Win key + Shift + S (Snipping tool)
* Ctrl-Shift-T (Reopen closed browser window)

Shortcuts I would like to use more: 
* Ctrl + F5 (Refreshes a page and overrides cache data)
* Win key + R (Opens Run menu)
* Alt + Left arrow key (Go back)
